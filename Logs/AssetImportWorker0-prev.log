Assets/bowl/bowl.c4d: Unity no longer supports importing Cinema 4D files directly, but we're working with Maxon to make the experience better. To import Cinema 4D files, install Maxon's external importer. You can find more information on the Unity Forum: https://on.unity.com/c4d.

Please note that FBX files exported from Cinema4D are still supported.
